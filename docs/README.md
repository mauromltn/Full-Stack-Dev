<h1 align=center>Portfolio Website</h1>
HiðŸ‘‹, I'm a software development student with zero prior experience, I created this repository to document my learning journey and build a personal website. This repository serves as a transparent record of my progress, challenges, and lessons learned in web development. Designed for simplicity, it's a showcase of my evolving skills and a resource that might resonate with others starting from scratch. Explore and enjoy the ride! ðŸš€
